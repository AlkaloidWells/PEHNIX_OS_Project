# THE ANALYSIS, DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF A Unix Shell, Kernel Module and Scheduler

                                       # ABSTRACT
As the world experiences new, innovative and advanced technologies in the manufacturing of computers ,the need for these computers to have performant, flexible and efficient operating systems has been a major point of attention. The LINUX operating system as one of the most widely used globally cant therefore be left out. It is in this regard that, our project titled “the analysis ,design and implementation of a unixshell,alinuxkernel module and a scheduler” was carried out . The entire project was subdivided into three parts ,where in each part, the specifications were considered,the requirements identified ,the algorithms designed and their implementation done with the required programming language enabling their successful realisation.Theare great advantages that these projects will bring to future Operating Systems Designs as they will improve the flexibility ,execution speed ,accuracy ,efficacy and performance of these operating systems especially the LINUX Operating System.

                                  # PROJECT OVERVIEW
The choice of our Project Title, as indicated on the cover page of this Report was not based on any special considerations and hypothesisbut it was aimed at reflecting and portraying some of the fundamental components of Software Development which involved ;ANALYSIS,DESIGN ,IMPLEMENTATION AND TESTINGsince the different Subtitles were aimed at demonstrating important characteristic features and functionalities of the Operating System with itself being part of the Software Architecture of every computer.
During the ANALYSISphase, it was an opportunity for us to read, understand and interpret the Problem statement of each parts of the Project and identifying the necessary and available requirements (software, hardware, and technology)needed, in order to meet up with the specifications.
The DESIGN phase, involved the identification and structurisation of different Algorithms which permitted us to have a clear inside about the Architecture of the System before its implementation. These Algorithms varied from one project to the other and also due to the difference of the Programming Languages.
After the ANALYSIS AND DESIGN Phases were completed successfully, The IMPLEMENTATION was all about transforming these Algorithms into executable Programs using the Specified Programming Languages .This was the Coding section of our project.
The TESTING Phase was an occasion for us to have a practical observation of these programs being executed which permitted us to correct running and compiler errors.
Our general aim was to see these indispensable components of the LINUX Operating system that is the Shell, Kernel Module and The Scheduler with the different Scheduling Algorithms well implemented with unique and specific features and our general motivation was the fact that The Project enabled us to have a practical understanding of the course and also to see each part of the project effective and appreciable.
The Subsequent Paragraphs ,we shall be elaborating more on each of these Parts of our


# PART I: UNIX SHELL
ANALYSIS: As clearly stated in the project specification document, the UNIX SHELL was aimed at enabling a user through it’s interface to give commands or instructions directly to the Kernel of The Operating System thereby bridging the barrier of using a preinstalled software to do so.
SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
 C programming Language(understanding and competence)
 Installation of the C programming Language Environment
 Installation of the LINUX Operating System
DESIGNS
1. User Account name Registration
2. User Welcome Page
3. Creation of command possibilities like cmd,exit, help.
4. Parent Process Creation through user first command
5. Child Process creation with roots from the parent
IMPLEMENTATION
1) Creating the Child Process and executing command in the child
2) Providing a history feature
3) Adding Support of input and output redirection
4) Allowing the child and parent process to communicate through a pipe
TESTING

                          # PROJECT 2: KERNEL MODULE
ANALYSIS: The implementation of a Kernel Module With the use of C Programming which permits the user to directly invoke Kernel functions.
SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
 C programming
 Kernel Programming
 Linux OS
 C programming environment
IMPLEMENTATION
1) Creating and Loading the Kernel Module in to the Linux Kernel
2) Loading and removing Kernel
3) The /proc file system
NB: put the screenshots for each

                          # PROJECT 3:SCHEDULLING ALGORITHMS
ANALYSIS: CPU SCHEDULLING enables the Operating System to maximise CPU Utilisation. These processes are scheduled based on certain considerations such as the throughput, cpu burst, turnaround time, waiting time etc.In order to ensure we don’t have a deadlock situation, different Algorithms permitted us to avoid such circumstances.
SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:
 Java programming language
 Windows operating system
 Netbeans for the user interface design

CONCLUSION
The Project was carried out successfully thanks to the engagement of all members
